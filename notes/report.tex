\section{Introduction}
In this project we studied and implemented a simulator of Shor's quantum
algorithm for integer factorization. The problem is reduced to the problem of
order finding. Although it is not known if order finding is hard in a classical
setting, Shor \cite{Shor} demonstrated that it is solvable in polynomial time if
one has access to a quantum computer, thus showing integer factorization is
solvable in polynoial time.


\section{Language and Tools}
Our simulation is implemented in Python 3, together with the numpy library.


\section{Implementation Overview}

\subsection{Memory}
The algorithm takes an odd integer $N$, such that it is not a prime nor a power
of a prime, and an integer $x, 1 < x < N$, and tries to find the multiplicative
order of $x$ modulo $N$.

It starts by allocating $t + n$ qubits, with $n = \lceil{\log_2 N}\rceil$ and
$N^2 \leq 2^t < 2N^2$, and initializes the state to $\ket{\psi_{0}} = \ket{0,
0}$.

We represent the memory by explicitly saving all the $2^{t+n}$ possible states and
their corresponding amplitudes, equivalent to the representation of the quantum
state as a linear vector combination $\ket{\psi} =
\sum_{j=0}^{t+n}a_{j}\ket{j}$.

\subsection{Hadamard Gates}
The algorithm then applies Hadamard gates to the first $t$ qubits. This creates
a quantum superposition where the amplitudes are equidistributed between the
first t bits. The state becomes $\ket{\psi_1} = H^{\otimes{t}}\ket{\psi_0} =
2^{-t/2}\sum_{j=0}^{2^t-1}\ket{j}\ket{0}$.

We simulate this step by explicitly reaching for the states where the last $n$
qubits are $\ket{0}$ and setting their amplitudes to $2^{-t/2}$.

\subsection{Modular Exponentiation}

In the next step, the operator $\ket{j, k} \mapsto \ket{j, k + x^j \pmod N}$ is
applied to all the qubits, giving the state
$\ket{\psi_2} =
2^{-t/2}\sum_{j=0}^{2^t-1}\ket{j}\ket{x^b}$.

This step is fast because it generates all the powers
simultaneously by quantum parallelism.

Here we take advantage of Python's built-in modular exponentiation function and
simulate this by applying the operator to all the states sequentially.

\subsection{Quantum Fourier Transform}
The discrete Fourier transform is then applied to the first t qubits. This step
is $O(n2^{n})$ if done classically, but can be done polynomially with a quantum
computer.

We simulate this step by sequentially applying the formula
$\ket{k} \mapsto 2^{-t/2} \sum_{j=0}^{2^{t}-1}\omega^{jk}\ket{j}$, where
$\omega^{jk} = e^{2\pi i j k / N}$,
to all the possible states, i.e., for each state $\ket{\phi} = \ket{k}$, its
amplitude is changed to $2^{-t/2} \sum_{j=0}^{2^{t}-1}\omega^{jk}$.

After the quantum state of the system is
$2^{-t/2}\sum_{j=0}^{2^{t}-1}\sum_{k=0}^{2^{t}-1}\omega^{jk}\ket{k}\ket{x^{j}}$


\subsection{Obtaining the Order}
Finally, a measurement is taken, leaving the state to collapse to one vector of
the computational basis. After the application of the previous operations we are
left with an approximation of a number $a/r, a \in \mathbb{Z}$ with high
probability.

We use a known efficient classical algorithm \cite{HW} for extracting $r$ based
on the best approximation property of the convergents of continued fractions. If
we succeed to find $r$, we return it, else the algorithm is restarted.


\section{Execution}

We can run the program by issuing the command
\begin{lstlisting}
  $ chmod +x shor.py
  $ ./shor.py N
